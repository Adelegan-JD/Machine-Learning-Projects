# Easy-Visa

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a predictive model for the Easy Visa Dataset. This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Project Introduction

Business communities in the United States are facing high demand for human resources, but one of the constant challenges is identifying and attracting the right talent, which is perhaps the most important element in remaining competitive. Companies in the United States look for hard-working, talented, and qualified individuals both locally as well as abroad.

### Project Objective

In FY 2016, the OFLC processed 775,979 employer applications for 1,699,957 positions for temporary and permanent labor certifications. This was a nine percent increase in the overall number of processed applications from the previous year. The process of reviewing every case is becoming a tedious task as the number of applicants is increasing every year.

The increasing number of applicants every year calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in shortlisting the candidates having higher chances of VISA approval. OFLC has hired the firm EasyVisa for data-driven solutions. My task is to analyze the data provided and, with the help of a classification model:
● Facilitate the process of visa approvals.
● Recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the drivers that significantly influence the case Status.
